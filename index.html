                    Hi, I’m Arufa Khanom (pronounced ah-roo-fah), currently a senior at Boston University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. My academic journey and hands-on experiences have equipped me with a unique intersection of technical expertise and business insight.
                    <br><br>
                    From leading a machine learning project on predicting movie revenue to integrating APIs into fully functional websites, I’ve developed a passion for solving real-world business challenges through innovative tech solutions. With proficiency in Python, Java, React, and SQL, I enjoy taking on complex problems and collaborating with dynamic teams to create impactful, scalable solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    What sets me apart is my drive to bridge the gap between technology and business. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights and tech tools to enhance decision-making and optimize processes in ever-evolving industries. Whether it's automating workflows or building intuitive user experiences, I am constantly motivated by the prospect of making a meaningful difference.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of coding, you’ll likely find me experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, planning my next travel adventure, or exploring hiking trails in the Pacific Northwest!
